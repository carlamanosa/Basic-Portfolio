            <p>My name is Carla Manosa. Currently, I am a student finishing my Master of Business Administration with a concentration in Supply Chain Management and Leadership and Management at the University of La Verne. Also, I am currently taking the UCI Full Stack Development/ Coding Bootcamp course to add to my technical skills and techniques to pursue a career in the technology industry.  </p>
            <br>

            </p>I reside in Diamond Bar, CA and am the youngest amongst my three siblings. Both my parents originated from the Philippines, but later moved to California for better opportunity for their families. My grandfather from my mother's side had a job with the U.S. Military which helped bring my mother's family to the United States. My father's family moved to California for better opportunity. </p>

            <br>
            <p>I have a beautiful nephew that is a German Shepard, Shitzu mix. He is 13 years old and always the center of attention!</p>
